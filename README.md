# 💡 Lightweight Carbon Fiber - ABS Sandwich Beam Design

This repository documents the design, analysis, and manufacturing of a lightweight, high-strength composite sandwich beam, capable of supporting a 1600 lbs load. This project was developed for the SAMPE Category H Bridge Competition and features a carbon fiber/epoxy prepreg face sheet with a 3D-printed ABS core.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

- **Goal**: Develop a high-performance structural beam with optimized weight and strength.
- **Materials**: 
  - Carbon fiber/epoxy prepreg (face sheets)
  - 3D printed ABS (core)
- **Weight Reduction**: Achieved a 54% weight reduction over the baseline while maintaining structural limits.
- **Theory Used**: Timoshenko beam theory (analytical) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) validation.
- **Manufacturing Method**: Prepreg vacuum bagging chosen through a decision matrix considering strength, cost, and manufacturability.
- **Reliability Tests**: Thermal warpage modeling and risk analysis validated the design.

## 📊 Features

- FEA-based structural simulation
- Material and geometry optimization
- Cost-performance design trade-off
- Structural test validation
